👋 Wow!!!

So good to see you here. My name is Marcos Cruz, I'm 56 years old, I'm Brazilian, Mônica's husband, Matheus and Victória's father. I am a post graduate in Information Technology Management, graduated in Computer Science. I was a C/C++ developer for over 8 years, then I worked as a team manager for infrastructure, projects, software development. Ahhh I was forgetting, also with the implementation of SAP, Sales Force and projects of e-commerce portals and legal content.

A lot, right?

Certainly yes, but now I'm in heaven!

No, I haven't died yet. I'm active and dreaming a lot, and dedicating myself to my great passion, Software Development and Architecture💞️.

👀 I’m interested in projects on the dotnet stack with angular and microservices. And since I don't know everything, I like to learn from my co-workers. I highly value respect and human relationships in a connected world.

🌱 I’m currently learning and playing with MongoDB as a database, Rabbitmq as a message broker, MassTransit for distributed messaging, authentication and authorization with IdentityServer4, EnvoyProxy as Api Gateway and single page frontend with Angular, and a few more things.
